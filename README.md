Visualising Gapminder's Bubbles with Shiny

Project Description
--------------------
I watched [this](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en) TedTalk by Dr. Hans Rosling couple years back, and ever since I've been his fan. I think the Bubble Graphs done in Gapminder Application are one of the best visualization design. Anyways, I have made that Bubble module (half-baked) in Shiny. Furthermore, you can also the gif version here below:
